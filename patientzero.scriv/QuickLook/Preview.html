<p class="binderItem"><strong>tonsillectomy</strong><br/>I'm laying in a hospital bed after an emergency tonsillectomy. As a child, having your tonsils removed is no big deal, but as an adult it's a bit of a shit storm. When I came in, it was almost too late, an abscess on my right tonsil was infected with some sort of plague. It was eating quickly into my lymph nodes, and the doctors figured the best thing to do was cut it out. Fast. I was fully conscious when I signed the form. Ten minutes later I was in a hospital gown and parked in a yellow hallwa...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>background</strong><br/>I don’t really have any family, but I have friends. I have a home and pets and a job. I have a pretty typical, every day kind of life. But lately, I've been thinking about escaping. As if I am trapped. <br/>
There’s just something about the work-a-day world that has been getting to me lately. Everyone has been walking around as if their lives are carved into stone. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen anyone make a brash decision. Everyone does what they’re told. I hate that about the world. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>doctor</strong><br/>I woke up at ten-thirty. “Goddamnit!” I said out loud. My doctor’s office wasn’t far away, but I’d just slept another nineteen hours. The thing on my neck was now the size of a baseball, regulation size. I skipped the shower after seeing the abscess. I just threw on some clothes and headed towards the doctor.<br/>
When I arrived, the waiting room was full. I waited at the reception desk behind two other patients. I was feeling inpatient, but also too sick to cause a fuss. <br/>
“I need your chip card,” th...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>planning escape</strong><br/>My roommate won’t stop talking to me. It’s just after noon, and I am plotting my escape. I’m still swallowing thick, gooey scabs, but I feel much better. My roommate is blathering on and on about how she met her husband, where they’ve been on vacation, and other various tidbits of her boring life. I lay back in my bed  and close my eyes. Miraculously, she shuts up. I’m not really tired anymore, I just want to leave here. I’m not allowed to use my cell phone, and I’m bored. <br/>
I’d called Dan two da...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>escape</strong><br/>The dental hygienist knocks over the instrument tray while mounting a patient. The patient is happy to be mounted, and I am the hygienist. As the dentist’s tools clatter to the floor, I see nurses opening the door.<br/>
Suddenly I’m awake, startled out of sleep by the nurses’ one thirty in the morning checkup. I quickly close my eyes again. One nurse leans in to my roommate, and the other observes me. I keep my eyes closed and try to breathe steadily. Two plastic cups, one with a suppository and one ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Onyx</strong><br/>The next morning, as I get dressed, I turn on the news. Harron Medical Center is back in the headlines.<br/>
Another death at Harron Medical Center early this morning, when a mortician was brutally murdered by an unidentified assailant. The assailant attacked Doctor Rodney Paul around three in the morning. Upon hearing screams, two orderlies ran to the scene. The orderlies have said that the assailant turned on them. One of the orderlies issued a sharp blow to the assailant’s head, causing instant de...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>conference room</strong><br/>“I don’t fucking care if Scott Spencer is begging for an audience to show off his fucking contact lenses. We’re not getting involved with those douchebags, even on a superficial level.” Jacob isn’t exactly yelling at June, but she looks distraught. She’s obviously been pushing the meeting for the last few minutes. <br/>
Eric and I have just entered the conference room.<br/>
“Oh, that reminds me,” I say to Eric, “in Kuala Lumpur, I found Scott Spencer and told him how fantastic you are. Dan and I had a nic...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Bethany Fordson</strong><br/>On the way out of the office, Eric grabs keys to one of the black A6s. We head downstairs and out into the parking lot.<br/>
“Let me drive,” I say. I love to drive. I don’t do it much because my life doesn’t require a car very often. I don’t even own one. I’m happy with my bicycle and public transportation, but I love to drive when the opportunity presents itself.<br/>
“No way, I’m driving.” Eric rides a bike to work too. I can only assume he feels the same way about driving as I do.<br/>
“Let me drive!” <br/>
“Not...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>hospital call</strong><br/>It’s the phone ringing that wakes me up. Eric is already awake, or maybe he never slept. In any case, he’s watching me. Normally, that would make me uncomfortable, but right now it doesn’t. <br/>
“How long have I been sleeping?”<br/>
“Just an hour,” he says as he reaches for the phone.<br/>
“No, don’t…” but it’s too late. <br/>
“Hello?…May I ask who’s calling?…I’d be happy to leave her a message…She’s not in at the moment…Yes, I understand, but she’s not in at the moment…I don’t have that kind of authority over her...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Intranet IRC</strong><br/>When we get back to the office, no one is in the conference room, but we didn’t need to look in to find that out. The eleventh floor is vibrating. We walk to Jacob’s office where we find Dan playing video games and yelling at the screens. I try several times to announce our arrival, but the volume is up too loud, and Dan is focused on a machete rampage. I wait until the rampage is over, then I tap his shoulder, he jumps three feet into the air, drops the controller, and puts his hands up like he...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>onyx bar</strong><br/>We have a pub. Not in the building or anything, but we have a pub down the street with low ceilings, green booths, and heavy wooden tables. It’s exactly the type of place you’d expect to see native barflies having drinks at ten thirty in the morning. It’s always open, mostly empty, and the building doesn’t attract any attention to itself. Oscar and I head out of the office in its direction. Neither one of us attempts small talk. Neither one of us is interested in the other’s personality or life....</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Bethany's call</strong><br/>All the lights are off. There’s a fleece blanket tangled around my legs. My left arm is asleep, and my back is stuck to the leather couch. I know I’m in Jacob’s office, but I don’t know what time it is or how long I’ve been sleeping. I lean forward and grab the bottle of water sitting next to the couch. I drink half the bottle and then notice the note attached to it, “Pull out your phone and call me right this second. - Eric”. I do as the note tells me and dial Eric’s number. It rings twice, the...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>orderly's description</strong><br/>I try to imagine it. I try to put myself in the orderlies shoes as they walk into the morgue to find a dead surgeon hovering over the body of a dead doctor. I try to smell the blood in the room. I try to imagine my own fight or flight response when someone or something were to attack me. The conversation Eric had with the orderly who hit the assailant, and his insistence that the man who killed the mortician was my dead surgeon made no sense to me. He said the assailant was slow, yet persistent ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>til Monday</strong><br/>We spend the rest of the day talking. We talk about our favorite superheroes and our inability to understand why our respective families treated us like we were inept. We muse over our misguided attempts at humor in social situations and our avoidance of hors d'oeuvres that are served on toothpicks. We cover topic after topic. We tell each other lost opinions we didn’t realize we had anymore. We talk about things I hadn’t thought of in years, things I’d buried thinking no one ever needed to know...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>onyx and the autopsy</strong><br/>We’re driving to Onyx. Eric didn’t want me to leave the apartment, but after the weekend we had, he can’t tell me no. He told Jacob he wasn’t coming into work, and he’s not changing his story, though technically we are going into the office. The streets are seemingly full for this time of day. The lunch buffets must have pushed their hours a bit, and sure enough I notice a group of sloppily dressed women waddling out of the China Hut on the other side of the intersection. A sea turtle on dry lan...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>vynal nerd dan</strong><br/>“Why do you need a jukebox anyway?” The stupidity of this particular conversation dawned on me over a year ago. Dan and I had been in Philadelphia for some sort of wacky, over-the-top library summit. I didn’t even know why we were there. I spent the entire event confused about my purpose in life. Dan spent the entire event talking about the jukebox he found on Ebay. We had a long winded discussion about “extracurricular appliances” in which I said that such devices served the “absurdity of consc...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>body</strong><br/>I suffer from a hereditary disease called Onychomycosis. It’s a non life-threatening nail fungus that about 10% of the adult population in western civilization have. The nails turn a little yellow, they’re brittle, they look kind of funny. I have it on my toenails, so you would never know about it. I don’t have a particularly severe case, so people never notice. Not my friends, not my lovers. It’s not on my hands, only my feet. For the longest time, I only had it on two toes - one on each foot. ...</p>
