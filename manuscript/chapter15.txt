#Chapter 15


"Ok," Dan says as he gingerly places a bottle filled with gasoline and a marble sized morning star with diamond dust on the spikes into the t-shirt cannon. "Want to make some bets about whether or not this thing ends up inside the box?"

Niela, Dan and I are standing in a clearing up the mountain from Niela's house. We'd taken the four-wheelers with Niela as a guide and set out with our test supplies immediately after the intern arrived with Oscar's kit. The kid must have been driving like a bat out of hell â€“ he'd arrived at 11:30am, a good forty-five minutes earlier than we'd expected. 

Dan and I had decided to buy two wooden boxes, fully constructed, at the hardware store. They were about a yard long on each side. Or better said, a meter, since Dan and I had gotten into a discussion about metric versus imperial units on the way to the store and decided that we weren't going to use "yards" anymore unless we were talking about "yard sales" or barbecues. 

We also bought two panes of reinforced glass and had them cut to fit the boxes. The sales guy recommended a fast drying epoxy and even helped us pry one side of each box off the boxes. 	The hardware store had the other supplies we needed. Tucked behind the lighting section, way in the back corner, there had been a small sampling of "construction attire". To our immense happiness, there are apparently construction crews that choose black cargo pants and though they didn't have women's sizes (surprise), they did have extra small. I tried the pants on right in the aisle, decided they fit, and bought a second pair for Niela. 

When we got back to the Hollow, at 11am, we only had to glue the glass to the box and wait an hour. After a cup of coffee, Niela had sent the intern back to the Bay Area, with a pat on the back and a "see you at the office". 

We'd managed to attach two wooden boxes to Dan's four-wheeler. The Stormshooter was strapped to my back and Niela had ten of the twenty morning stars in her cargo pants. She had put the pants on as soon as we got back and refused to take off until after the mission. "I just want to be this cool for as long as possible," she'd said. 

The Stormshooter came with a stand and the cannon is pointing at the sky. The whole thing is a bit bulky and heavy,  especially with the two ten kilogram CO2 tanks we'd purchased. Riding into the hills with all our gear attached to the sides of the four-wheelers was a lot different than having to schlepp it all up the side of the hill behind the Intervision complex. Still, without the wooden boxes, and with the three of us, it should be manageable. We decided that if push came to shove, we would leave all the equipment strewn on the hillside and take the monetary hit. It's not like Onyx is going to care about a few thousand dollars of lost equipment, though we usually try to keep our sunk costs low. 

We'd needed to buy wide mouthed bottles because the morning stars wouldn't fit through the neck of the wine bottles we had lying around at the Hollow. There'd been a bit of a panic when we realized this because none of us knew where to buy bottles with a wider neck. In the end, we'd headed back to the hardware store and looked in the gardening section. Sure enough, there were a variety of old fashioned, but newly manufactured, milk bottles and jars in a section for homemade marmalades and wine. We bought ten milk bottles and tried to convince the clerk that fifty dollars was a ridiculous price for useless glass. We'd asked for a discount because we were buying ten. The clerk had just shrugged and waited without saying anything. 

"Are you ready?" Dan asks Niela through the walkie talkie. Niela is in sprinting position a more than halfway between us and the wooden box. The box is about two football fields away with a fire extinguisher nearby. This morning, we'd decided against filling the Molotovs with laundry detergent and instead opted for a real world test. We're hopeful that we don't start a forest fire. The spot Niela brought us to was relatively shady, so the grass isn't so dry, but it's still kind of dangerous what we're doing here.

"Yes!" She answers. 

"ALRIGHT, HERE WE GO!" Dan yells and the radio cackles with feedback. "Dude," he says to me, "I'm not sure I can aim this thing."

The Stormshooter has a giant scope with crosshairs etched in, but neither of us is too sure about it's accuracy. 

"You'll just have to try it," I say.

"Alright, here we go," Dan says again as he lowers the cannon and aims through the scope. The cannon trajectory and the scope are on different planes. The crosshairs are pointed directly on the box, but the cannon is pointed upwards. He pulls the trigger and the molotov shoots in a wide arc above Niela's head. Nanoseconds later it hits square in the front of the box and flames erupt. Niela reaches it quite quickly, sprays the whole thing with the fire extinguisher. Dan and I run over.

"Good god that was accurate!" 

"Yeah! Five grand will buy you a helluva t-shirt cannon!" 

"Did it break?"

We look at the reinforced glass on the front of the box. It's covered in foam from the extinguisher and I wipe it away with my foot. The single morning star we'd put in the molotov is stuck right in the center of the glass. Cracks radiate out from it, but the glass is still whole.

"Bullseye," says Dan. 

"Well, at least we know the scope works. We have to try again though, the glass needs to break and fire needs to be on the inside. We're a few hundred yards..."

"Meters!" Dan interrupts.

"...meters further out then we will be at Intervision. So if it works at this distance, everything will work more better there."

"I get to shoot this time!" Niela says. Dan grabs the extinguisher and sets it away from the box. He walks with us until he reaches Niela's former position in the middle of the clearing. Niela and I go back to the Stormshooter and fill another bottle with gasoline. We put three morning stars in it this time. Niela, without a lot of fanfare or hesitation, puts the bottle into the cannon, lights it and aims at the box. She pulls the trigger without warning and then screams "Run Dan!"

Dan runs towards the box, grabs the extinguisher and sprays the fire that's spreading a bit too quickly. Niela and I run over. I help Dan put out the flames with my feet. We see that the three morning stars have done the trick. The inside of the box is covered in flames. 

Dan douses them and then says, "Ok, well I guess we can go. Shit works." He pulls out a knife and starts picking the single morning star still in the box out from the wood.

"Nope," I say. "You fuckers got to shoot, I get to shoot. We didn't lug that second box up here for nothing."

"But we shouldn't waste these little babies, we'll never find them in the grass. And also let's not start a fucking forest fire." Dan says, throwing the morning star around like a hot potato.

"We have enough, and one of you just stand a bit closer to get the fire out faster. I'll try two, and maybe we will save them on site."

"Not it!" Yells Niela.

"Not what?"

"I'm not on fire safety duty, you've gotta do it again, Dan."

"That's cool," he says, "I like saving the day."

I head back to the cannon and concoct the third and final test cocktail. I put two morning stars in it and take aim. I pull the trigger and am astounded by the lack of kick this forceful weaponized fun gun has. 

Two morning stars also shatter the glass. There's just enough foam in the fire extinguisher to douse my flames too. 

We discuss briefly and then decide after she pours soap in the fountain and launches the red kayak, Niela will shoot five random windows in buildings one, two and three on the Intervision campus. She'll use ten of the morning stars in quick succession, and then pack up and head back down to the car. 

We head back down the mountain. We need to go back to the hardware store and buy a few more bottles.
