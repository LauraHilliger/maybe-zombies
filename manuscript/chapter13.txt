#Chapter 13

"I don't care about the apocalypse, end of the world, clandestine schnoolipoops that's going on here. We're stopping in Carson City for two hours, and I'm going to win 739$ and a bunch of free drinks!" 

"Dan, look, Sonora has drinks and casinos too..." I know I'm not going to win this argument. We've been driving for more than five hours, and Dan's cranky morning mood only got worse. Even the twenty minute detour to stare at the Shoe Tree, a diversion Dan insisted on after singing a song about a pair of old shoes he'd owned as a boy, didn't cheer him up. He had managed a single clap and said, "I wonder what kind of sorted stories these shoes were privy to."

"I don't care, Maggie. I need a roulette table and a rush of dopamine. I need to pour a Mai Tai on this and just have some fucking fun. My feelings are valid."

"Yes, Dan, your feelings are valid," I sigh. "Hey, remember when we were in Malaysia and you gave me a Mai Tai after my talk?"

"No."

"Oh. Well I think that was the drink that started everything."

"What are you talking about? Was that how we had sex?"

"Hey, we said we were never speaking of that again."

"Oh yeah...started what then?"

"This whole thing."

"For fuck's sake, Maggie, my brain isn't actually connected to yours. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about."

"I'm saying that Mai Tai started 'the apocalypse, end of the world, clandestine schnoolipoops' you want to ignore so you can gamble."

"And how, pray tell, does a fucking Mai Tai become responsible for the end of the world? No, really, I'm curious. How does a rum based, Cura√ßao driven beverage get ultimate responsibility for the destruction of humankind that you're standing at the helm of? The way I see it, this all started when you left Harron against doctor's orders."

I don't respond. I feel hurt. I know Dan didn't mean to hurt me, but I haven't quite processed the trauma that is my life. I was depressed before all of this started, and now I'm running on fumes. For a moment in all of this, I was happy. Eric made me feel light and inspired. Like something mattered. Like I mattered. But Eric is gone. It's been three days since the last time week spoke. I can't decide if I'm angry with him or worried. Somehow the anger melts into worry, but a selfish worry. I'm worried that I've lost him. I'm in love. I didn't tell him I was in love. He told me. I didn't tell him. What if I never have the opportunity? What if I have to live the rest of my life knowing that I didn't tell him? What if by the time I get around to telling him he doesn't love me back.

I shake my head. I actively shove Eric into a mental compartment to push the pain I'm feeling into a small box. I meditate for a moment on the fact that I will die, we will all die, existence is futile. I meditate on how life is just all the energy of the universe finding ways to dissipate into nothingness. Evolution, it would seem, is less about survival and more about efficiency. We humans are just efficient at absorbing atmospheric energy and dissipating it again. I remind myself that our thoughts and feelings, our intuitions and behaviours, all that we are, is just energy processing. That's it. The meaning of life. The purpose of all life is universal entropy. I feel myself calm.

"I didn't start anything," I say. "But I sure as hell am going to finish it."

"After we gamble."

"Yes, after we gamble."

I watch the world go by outside the window until Dan pulls into his casino of choice. It's the middle of the afternoon, but the parking lot is almost full. Judging from the makes and models of the cars, we're not going to be running into any high rollers at this establishment. 

"Can you imagine naming your business anything with the word 'nugget' in it?"

"No, but come on, this is gold rush country. I bet there's a museum here that has the biggest nugget of gold found in over a hundred years."

"I bet there's a glass case inside this very casino that has the biggest nugget of *fools* gold found in the last hundred years."

"I'll bet you five dollars."

"Shake on it." We shake hands, and the irony of our bet has both of us smiling. I have to admit, Dan was right. We need a break. Some fun. A little distraction from the darkness. Of course, in about two minutes we'll actually be leaving the bright, hot Nevada summer sun and entering a casino that will have no natural light. It will be smoky and sordid. The sad faces of the types of people who hang out in random casinos at four in the afternoon on a Tuesday.

Two blue columns skirt the doors of the Golden Nugget Casino. The base of each is a showy gold block, formed like a giant rivet adorning a pitbull's collar. A three story sack of, presumably, gold sits atop the columns embellished with a thousand lightbulbs. I wish we would have arrived late enough to see the lights dance and blink. The word CASINO surely had some sort of a wavy light show. 

The doors open. We leave the outside world and fall into the dark bowel of a gambling abyss. The light through the glass doors seems to evaporate and a sea of cowboy hats bobbles around slot machines. A dim, artificial vibe emits from the complicated, geometric carpeting and the florescent lights break pattern only above a mechanical bull. A single spotlight lights the bull, its fearsome head twisted in frozen rage. I laugh a little when I notice one of the horns is little more than a stump. The floor around the bull is tiled in what looks to be leather. 

Dan will ride that thing before we leave this place, I just know it.

All at once I feel overwhelmed by the auditory of the place as it hits me. The ding and zing and bloop of the various slot machines. The chatty, drunk couples that are cracked out on gaming and haven't been to bed in thirty hours. A waitress asks a solemn man if he wants another drink. Croupiers tell customers when the house wins. The deafening buzz of being alive in the world hits me, and I think about what it would be like if all the noise stopped. 

I remember an episode of the Twilight Zone where everyone is forced to be happy by a mind controlling little boy. For some reason he hates singing. The neural pathways shoot and a scene from Footloose marred in my memory pops up. Flashes of power cables pulled out of walls and the brutal screech of a slipping record needle pan out into an auditory deficiency. Somehow I follow my thoughts back to the InterVision goggles. I felt like the vidi that was my vision was sucked away in the murky colors of the night vision "enhanced" world. 

"I will ride that mechanical bull before we leave here. Just warnin' ya," Dan slaps me on the ass as he strolls off towards the closest waitress. 

"As long as you don't think you're driving the bat Cadillac," pointing to the Batmobile paint job on the random caddy in the lobby. Four and a half minutes later, Dan hands me a drink as I'm sticking a quarter into a slot machine. I pull the lever and hit three lemons. Thin, high strung music plays an annoying melody and coins dump out of the machine. 

"That's probably a good twenty bucks right there! Well done playa!" The rush of dopamine from winning and Dan's elated congratulation rip me back into the present. 

"Let's play some more." At the cash window, we get five hundred in chips. We convince ourselves that we might as well live it up in the dirt town of our lives since we might not have a lot of life yet. Not that either one of us is overly fearful. I mean, what's really going on. A couple of people are dead or missing and we're somehow involved. Not traumatic at all. We are tardigrades, all the death and gore that exists in my head is actually no big deal. Everything is going to be fine. We're all just dissipating energy anyway.

I keep my eye on the clock as Dan and I throw money around. Winning, losing, doesn't matter. We're up for the first fifty minutes. I'm winning at blackjack, and Dan is jumping between tables following his imaginary Fortuna. We're both drunk on the happy brain chemicals that are being exasperated by the pleasure of winning and free booze. After a little over an hour, the tide of winning begins to turn. 

"Ok, enough sport. Time for food." Dan collects the chips from the roulette table.

"Hold on, I want to play one more..."

"Nope!" Dan shouts, "The art of gambling is to win, either you're done or you are a gambling addict." He pulls me away from the table and heads to the cash window. "We need chicken fried something and a bucket of fries. Oh, and a cold frosty beer. Here you go," he says as dumps his chips into a buck at the cash window.

As the lady dumps the chips into a separating machine and opens the cash drawer, Dan turns to me seriously.

"You know," he says, "we didn't settle our bet."

"Well, we haven't left yet."

"Ok, this is the order of things. First we cash in because that activity is already in process. Then we get a table at the *Dusty Nugget* and order food. We inform the waitress that we will return momentarily and leave your horrifying cardigan there as collateral for the table. *Then we find the nugget.*" He says his last sentence as if we're going to be doing recon for an elite military unit or collecting specimens from a spaceship. 

"Sir, I have $937 dollars for you." 

"$937!? What are the chances!"

I turn my chips in next and the process starts over. Chips go in, numbers come out. Dan is too excited by the coincidence of "winning $739 dollars backwards" to notice that I've pulled in over six hundred myself despite the fact that he only gave me fifty bucks, along with a overtly sexist statement about how men should keep a reign on the finances, to play with. We'd tripled our money.

We follow Dan's plan and order chicken-fried chicken and green beans, a bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy. He asks that two beers be brought to us as soon as we come back. The waiter, a twenty year old kid who looked as if he'd been hit one too many times while playing football, just stares. 

We find a glass case containing the golden nugget inside of ten minutes tucked away around reception in a different part of what turns out to be a mini resort. It's not the largest of anything, but rather a nugget shaped kind of like an Egyptian Sphinx. It has a name plate that calls it "the Oracle Nugget". 

"No one wins this bet, Maggie. No one wins."

We laugh as we head back to the restaurant, and we laugh more as we eat and drink our beers. 

"So," I slur after packing in the last of the chocolate cheesecake I ordered for dessert, "who's driving?"

---
Both of us are drunk enough that we shouldn't be driving, so order the strongest coffee they have.

"To driving in a moderately sober state," Dan says as he holds up his cup. 

"Ten minutes," I say. We slurp the coffee as quickly as we can without burning our faces. 

When it's time to leave, Dan stops me at the front door, turns me towards the inside of the casino and says, "Maggie, you will never be in this establishment again. Embrace it."

In the parking lot we play a rapid fire game of trivia to work out who is most sober to drive. Dan purposefully misses and easy question and I win. I'm more sober to drive. I don't mind, I don't feel all that drunk. I am only slightly worried about curving up into the hills of the Sierra Nevadas. The inside of the car is hot.

"I guess it'll be dark when we get there," Dan says sadly.

"Ahh what's the matter big boy, does someone want to play on the four wheelers, hmmm?" I taunt.

"Duh," he pouts, and I turn on the car. Pulling out of the parking lot I scan through the radio channels until I find something that sounds slightly punk. I notice the knob of the radio feels
