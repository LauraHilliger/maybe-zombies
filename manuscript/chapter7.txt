#Chapter 7

“Oscar got the video, I haven’t watched it yet.” Dan is driving so erratically it’s hard to hold the phone to my ear. 

“Don’t. Don’t watch it. I want first dibs.” I can hear Eric smiling, but I don’t trust him not to watch it before I arrive. “We’ll be there in about fifteen minutes, don’t watch it without me.”

“Alright, alright. Geez, I won’t. Anything else you’d like to dictate?”

“Actually, yeah. Can you get the first aid kit out of the kitchen? I’m going to need it.” I know the request will spur a follow up question, but Eric is going to find out about my arm in a few minutes anyway, so I might as well prepare him.

“What for? What happened? Are you ok?” His overbearing concern is starting to annoy me, but I’d be more annoyed if he didn’t ask. 

“Dan and I ran into a...uh...zombie kind of thing. I don’t know, my brain hasn’t processed it yet. Can zombies exist? Cause I’m pretty sure we just met one and he bit me.”

“No. Zombies don’t exist. Meth heads exist, they’re almost the same.”

“Right, well no worries then. It’s just a gigantic slop of flesh wound.” I’m sure Eric can hear my smile, and for some reason the bite really doesn’t hurt. The wound looks like a cherry parfait filled with boiling cottage cheese. It’s not bleeding. The blood isn’t so much clotted as it is crystalized. It’s metallic looking where it’s red, not matte. 

“Christ, I can’t leave you alone for a second.”

“Nope, I get into all sorts of trouble.”

“Oh fer Chrissakes, you two! I can smell your pheromones and it’s fucking gross!” Dan yells, then leans on the horn. I say goodbye and hang up the phone. We’ve got another twelve minutes to the office. 

I lose myself for the rest of the ride, and even Dan is weirdly silent. When we park the car at the office, Dan looks at me. 

“I think I should go to the hardware store and buy some stuff for the impending apocalypse. Better do it before the rest of the masses get wise to this shit.” He sounds serious, too serious. Resigned and serious.

“Oh Dan, don’t be so dramatic. You’re allowed to start freaking out if I go all glassy-eyed like that cowboy and start trying to eat people. Until then, that was just a freak occurrence.”

“Whatever man. That dude was grey. And I’m pretty sure that’s the guy that’s always hanging out at our pub.”

“Yeah. It was. I saw him when I bought Oscar a beer last week. He was wearing the same clothes...though, they weren’t so tattered.”

“What? You saw that guy last week? Was he...was he looking like that?”

“He looked like old-drunk-cowboy-guy.” In my mind, I count backwards. I’d been in the bar last Thursday. It was now Wednesday afternoon. Six days. I’d had surgery six days before the surgical team died. I scan my brain looking for more connections between my interactions at Harron and at the bar and can’t think of anything.

“Are you, like, going to get out?” Dan has been staring at me. 

“You’re not really going to the hardware store. Are you?” 

“Oh I guess not. But I’m not coming in, I’m going home. I’m going to start drinking. You can come by later if you want, but I will be drunk and wearing only my tightie whities.”

“Right. Well, if that image leaves my mind, I might come by.” I get out of the car and hear Dan pull out as I’m walking to the building. I go inside, answer my security questions, grab a skateboard, transverse the hallway, get through the “Fear” and head up to the eleventh floor. In the elevator I poke at the bite. I squish it and watch the cottage cheese bubble up. When I release pressure, the white goo sinks down like the wound is a swimming pool, and the hot summer sun has evaporated enough water to be noticeable, but not enough for the pool to need refilling. It still doesn’t hurt.

I don’t see Eric when the doors open, but June is sitting in Jacob’s office next to the first aid kit. 

“I’ve noticed Eric has been overly concerned about you,” she says as I enter the room. 

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

June rolls her eyes, uncrosses and recrosses her legs and threads her fingers together. Her hair is perfectly straight with two small ribbon barrettes perfectly aligned on each side of her head. They look as if they are glued on. Her cleavage, as always, is spilling out of her kelley-green top and her pants are so tight, I think that if I rubbed paint thinner on her, they would just disappear. She’s wearing cork heeled platforms and a gold anklet. Every piece of her is in place, as per usual. 

“You know, I always looked up to you, but you’ve never given me the time of day,” I inadvertently snort and immediately feel bad about it. She smirks as she adds “because you’re a bitch.” Her breasts bobble when she speaks.

“I’m sorry, June. I didn’t mean to be rude. You just took me by surprise, I’ve always felt like you hated me,” I try to use a kind tone. 

“I do. And I always have, but that doesn’t mean I don’t respect you. At least, I did. Until I found out that you’re boinking the boss.”

“Oh shut up June,” kindness evaporated. It is the use of the word “boinking” that pisses me off. We had not been “boinking”. Or “fucking”. Or “screwing”. I think back for a moment and realize that we had done those things. I flash back to a steamy handprint on one of the penthouse windows. Then I admit to myself “fucking” and “screwing had, indeed, occurred, but “boinking” most certainly not.

June’s eyes widen and the smirk on her face disappears. Calmly, she pushes the first aid kit towards me, “Christ Maggie, that looks bad.” I feel myself soften towards her. Maybe June’s bitchy personality is just a front. She actually does respect me. She doesn’t hate me in the slightest. 

“Yeah. I need to stitch this up. Maybe we can resume our animosity towards each other some other time?”

“Look, as far as I’m concerned, you’re vetted. So you must be smart, unique, et cetera. Just stay out of my way.” We’re family at Onyx, June is my jealous cousin. 

“Are you talking about my relationship with Eric? Because it wasn’t planned,” June needs to understand. She has to know that I’m not sleeping my way anywhere. 

“No. I don’t fucking care about you and Eric,” she sighs. “Do me a favor and stop badmouthing InterVision in front of Jacob. I need Scott Spencer to trust us, I have a plan. It won’t work without him.”

I’m taken aback by her request. I hadn’t said anything about InterVision. Over the past few days I’d forgotten about everything other than the Harron situation. Why was June so insistent on this InterVision relationship? I ask her. 

“Fine, I’ll tell you. InterVision is on to something, and they’re starting to up their game with government agencies. I met with Scott Spencer, he is trying to recruit me.”

“Uh...maybe you shouldn’t tell me this. You can’t leave Onyx and go somewhere else, you signed that crazy no compete just like the rest of us did.” Onyx has all its employees sign an air tight No Compete agreement that states that should one choose to leave Onyx, they will be paid fifty percent of their salary for five years after which they can find new employment. Should one manage to get fired, the clause remains, but with only thirty-five percent payment. No one has ever been fired, and I’ve never seen anyone leave. Three people have died, but the rest of us are still here. The last person we hired was three years ago.

“Don’t be stupid! I’m not leaving Onyx, I want to play Scott and make plans to subvert the government contracts,” she looks pleased with herself. 

“Oh! Well, Jacob would be on board with that! Why don’t you just tell him?”

“I don’t want to be vocal about the plans. I’m trying to manage expectations,” June stands up, punctuating the word “expectations” and says “So? Can you keep your mouth shut?”

“Will do,” and I flip open the first aid kit.

June walks out as I’m threading the needle. I use gauze to sop up the pus. It takes a lot of gauze. The white cottage cheese is just a layer on top of a green and yellow pus. The layers stick together. I consider whether or not I need to wire brush out the infection. I don’t feel like going to look for a wire brush, so I scrub with the gauze until droplets of blood surface. The blood looks normal.

I get up to pull the trash can over, slide the gauze in and use alcohol to wipe the slime from the top of the coffee table where it had been piled. I pour iodine the wound. I balance the needle between my thumb and the top of the wound, and use the knuckle of my right forefinger to squish the tear closed. As I start to shove the needle through, Eric stomps into the room.

“You’re starting to piss me off,” his anger is visible. “You come in with a wound like that and fucking chit chat with June instead of calling me and you’re trying to sew it yourself? I have to hear about it from June? You need to learn how to ask for help.” He takes the needle from me and looks into the trashcan. His tone softens. 

“That looks nasty.” 

My arm looks about ninety percent better since I’ve cleaned it, and I’m glad Eric wasn’t there for that part.

He observes the wound, mumbles something about a doctor, but doesn’t press the issue as he knows I won’t be going to a clinic. He pushes the tear together and starts sewing. Twenty-two perfect stitches later, he leans back. 

“Do you want to tell me exactly what happened?”

I tell him about the cowboy. I leave out the fact that we stashed the body in a shed.

“Do I need to send a cleanup team?” I consider for a moment.

“I think I might have left one of his fingers on the ground,” it slips out as I remember closing the trunk. I stare at Eric. “Uh, I kind of stashed the guy’s body in a shed.”

Eric looks unamused. He shakes his head, “Kind of? You mean to tell me that you and Dan accidentally kill a guy and then drag his body somewhere?”

“It was a zombie.”

“There’s no such thing as zombies.”

“If I take you to the shed, I can prove it.”

“No, you can’t. You’ll show me a dead body, which proves nothing. What about the finger?”

“Oh leave it, a dog probably ate it.” 

Eric pulls out his phone, uses speed dial and says “Chimney. Dual addresses incoming,” then hangs up again. He looks at me, “I need the address where you might have left the finger and wherever the shed is.”

“Really? ‘Chimney’? Like ‘chimney sweep’?” I’m almost laughing at the obviousness of the command. “Is that supposed to be clever?”

“Just give me the addresses,” Eric’s tone is not kind. I explain as best as I can where in the apartment complex courtyard we’d been and how to get to the quarry.

“Maybe I should just go with them?”

“No,” His tone is still not kind. I stand up, look down at him and tell him that if he needs anything else he can text me. Then I turn to walk out of the room. I’m all the way to the door and so is he. Eric slams the door shut in front of me.

“Do you think I’m just going to let you walk away from me?” his tone is still harsh, I’m not sure what’s happening. He shoves me up against the door and kisses me hard, grabs my right breast, squeezes it too hard. I push him away, but he grabs my wrists and jams me back up against the door. “You don’t get to walk away from me,” his tone is different. Still harsh, but off-kilter. I can feel his dick on my thigh, but I can’t figure out if I’m turned on. I can’t figure out if Eric is about to punish me or about to “punish” me. I decide for defense, push him away and scramble out from under him. 

Facing him now, I tense up and ask “What the fuck is this? What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”

He places his hand on the back of my neck and roughly pulls me towards him. He pauses for a moment, looks into my eyes and holds the gaze as he kisses me. I see what’s going on. I relax into it. We have rough, quick sex with me bent over one of the armchairs. When we’re finished, Eric spins me around.

“When you’re bad, I’m going to treat you badly. Like that.”

“Noted.” 

“Now, do you want to watch the video of Paul’s murder or what?”
